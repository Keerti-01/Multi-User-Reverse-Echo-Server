# Multi-User-Reverse-Echo-Server
The Multiuser Reverse Echo Server project aims to develop a server application capable of handling multiple client connections concurrently and reversing any messages received from clients before sending them back. This project demonstrates the use of Java networking libraries, multi-threading'

Concurrent Client Handling: The server can accept and manage multiple client connections simultaneously using multi-threading.
Each client connection is handled in a separate thread to ensure non-blocking communication and scalability.

Message Reversing and Echoing: The server receives messages from clients, reverses the strings, and sends back the reversed messages.
Ensures real-time communication and response to each client.

Client-Server Communication: Utilizes TCP/IP sockets for reliable communication between the server and clients.
Ensures proper connection establishment, message transmission, and disconnection protocols.

Logging and Monitoring: Implements logging mechanisms to track client connections, received messages, reversed messages, and any errors encountered.
Provides console outputs or log files for monitoring server activity and debugging.



Technical Implementation:
Server-Side:

Java Networking: Uses ServerSocket to listen for incoming client connections on a specified port.
Multi-threading: Employs Thread or ExecutorService to create a new thread for each client connection.
I/O Streams: Uses BufferedReader and PrintWriter to read from and write to client sockets.
String Manipulation: Implements a method to reverse the received string before sending it back to the client.

Client-Side:

Java Networking: Uses Socket to connect to the server.
I/O Streams: Uses BufferedReader and PrintStream to send messages to and receive messages from the server.
User Interaction: Handles user input and output through the console.


Project Modules:

Server Module:
Listens for incoming client connections.
Creates a new thread for each client connection.
Reads messages from clients, reverses them, and echoes them back.
Logs client activity and server status.

Client Module:
Connects to the server.
Sends messages to the server and receives reversed messages.
Handles user input and displays server responses.
